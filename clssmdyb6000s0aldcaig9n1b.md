### Introduction

Efficient file editing is a fundamental skill for anyone working with servers or programming. In this blog, we'll explore two powerful text editors - Vim (vi) and Nano. We'll walk through the basics of each editor, covering essential commands for seamless file manipulation.

### Text Editors Overview

1. **Vim (vi):**
    
    * Known for its versatility and powerful features.
        
    * Requires a bit of learning but offers efficient navigation.
        
2. **Nano:**
    
    * Beginner-friendly and straightforward.
        
    * Offers a more intuitive interface compared to Vim.
        

### **Editing Modes in Vim**

1. **Command Mode:**
    
    * Default mode for navigation.
        
    * Use `gg` to go to the top of the file.
        
    * Press `Shift + G` to jump to the bottom.
        
    * `:set number` shows line numbers.
        
    * Use `:n` to go to a specific line.
        
    * Copy lines with `yy` and paste with `p`.
        
    * Delete lines with `dd`.
        
    * Undo with `u` and redo with `Ctrl + R`.
        
    * Search for a word using `/word`.
        
2. **Insert Mode:**
    
    * Press `i` to enter insert mode.
        
    * `A` appends text at the end of the line.
        
    * `I` inserts at the beginning of the line.
        
    * `O` creates a new line above the current line.
        
    * `o` creates a new line below the current line.
        
3. **Save Mode:**
    
    * Press `Esc` to exit insert mode and enter command mode.
        
    * Use `:w` to save changes.
        
    * `:q` quits the editor.
        
    * `:wq` saves and quits.
