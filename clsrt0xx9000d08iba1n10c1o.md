### **Roles in Software Development & Delivery**

1. **Software Development:**
    
    * *Responsibilities:* Building applications, deploying them on servers, upgrading existing software.
        
    * *Team:* Primarily done by the development team.
        
    * *Languages:* Programmed in different languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript.
        
2. **Software Testing:**
    
    * *Responsibilities:* Testing new features, bug fixes, ensuring software functionality.
        
    * *Team:* Involves both developers and dedicated testers.
        
    * *Testing:* Involves manual and automated testing.
        
3. **Operations:**
    
    * *Responsibilities:* Running software in production, maintaining stability.
        
    * *Team:* Mainly done by the operations team.
        
    * *Technical Knowledge:* Requires knowledge of operating systems, command-line, scripting, and monitoring tools.
        

### **Development vs. Operations**

1. **Focus:**
    
    * *Development:* Emphasizes implementing new features quickly.
        
    * *Operations:* Focuses on maintaining stability.
        
2. **Technical Knowledge:**
    
    * *Development:* Involves programming languages, test frameworks, databases, and version control.
        
    * *Operations:* Requires knowledge of OS, command-line, scripting, and monitoring tools.
        
3. **Toolsets:**
    
    * *Development:* Utilizes tools for coding, testing, and version control.
        
    * *Operations:* Relies on tools for monitoring, deployment, and configuration.
        

### **Challenges in Traditional Setup**

1. **Miscommunication:**
    
    * Deployment requires communication for configurations and environment preparation.
        
2. **Conflict of Interest:**
    
    * Development focuses on releasing new features, while operations prioritize system stability.
        
3. **Manual Work & Checklists:**
    
    * Manual checks, manual deployment, and configurations slow down the release process.
        

### **DevOps Culture**

DevOps aims to eliminate the challenges and inefficiencies present in traditional setups. It encourages:

* Collaboration between Development and Operations.
    
* Automation of manual processes.
    
* Streamlining release cycles for faster and more reliable software delivery.

### **Solution: DevOps Culture 1**

* *Simplest Definition:*
    
    * Intersection of Development and Operations.
        
    * Provides a common language for communication.
        
* *Better Definition:*
    
    * Aims for fast, error-free continuous delivery.
        
    * Eliminates roadblocks, streamlining release processes through automation.
        

### **Solution: DevOps Culture - 2**

* Common patterns in DevOps implementation include:
    
    * Planning & Collaboration.
        
    * Source Code Management.
        
    * Package Management.
        
    * Continuous Integration/Deployment.
        
    * Infrastructure as Code.
        
    * Container Orchestration.
        
    * Cloud Adoption.
        
    * Continuous Monitoring.
        

### **DevOps as a Separate Role**

* Evolution into the "DevOps Engineer" role.
    
* Filled by developers, operations professionals, or dedicated DevOps individuals.
    
* Responsible for implementing DevOps principles and creating automated release processes.
    

### **DevOps Tasks and Responsibilities - 1**

* Requires a blend of knowledge from both Development and Operations.
    
* Demands additional DevOps-specific skills and know-how.
    

**DevOps Tools**

* **Git:** Source Code Management.
    
* **Jenkins/GitLab:** Continuous Integration/Delivery.
    
* **Docker:** Package Management.
    
* **Terraform/Ansible:** Infrastructure as Code.
    
* **Kubernetes:** Container Orchestration.
    
* **Cloud** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
    
* **Prometheus:** Continuous Monitoring.
    

### **At the Core of DevOps: CI/CD Pipeline for an Automated Release Process**

* Essence lies in the CI/CD pipeline.
    
* Replaces manual tasks with automation:
    
    * Commit Code TEST BUILD PUSH DEPLOY.
        
* Ensures a faster, more reliable software release cycle.
