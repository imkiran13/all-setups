### **Introduction**

Git, the Global Information Tracker, is a powerful distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate seamlessly, and manage versions effectively. In this blog, we'll explore the basics of Git, its role in version control, and the fundamental stages of working with Git.

### **What is Version Control?**

Version control is a crucial aspect of software development, enabling teams to manage and track changes in their codebase. Git, a distributed version control system (DVCS), stands out for its efficiency and flexibility.

### **Understanding Version Control**

Imagine you're developing an application with multiple versions:

* Version 1: 100 lines of code
    
* Version 2: 200 lines of code
    
* Version 3: 300 lines of code
    

Git allows you to store each version separately, maintaining a record of the changes made over time.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Repository (Repo):** A folder where code is stored.
    
* **Working Directory:** Where you write your source code.
    
* **Staging Area:** Where files are tracked before committing.
    
* **Rollback:** The ability to revert to a previous version of the application.
    

### **Git Workflow**

1. **Initialize a Git repository:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git init
    ```
    
2. **Create a file (e.g., index.html):**
    
    ```plaintext
    vim index.html
    ```
    
3. **Check the status of the repository:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git status
    ```
    
4. **Track the file:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git add index.html
    ```
    
5. **Check the status again:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git status
    ```
    
6. **Commit the changes:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git commit -m "commit-1" index.html
    ```
    

### **Viewing Commit History**

* **View all commits:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git log
    ```
    
* **View the last 2 commits:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git log -2
    ```
    
* **View commits in a single line:**
    
    ```plaintext
    git log -2 --oneline
    ```
    

### **Conclusion:**

Git simplifies version control, making it an essential tool for every developer. Understanding the basics of Git and its workflow empowers you to effectively manage and collaborate on software projects. As you continue your coding journey, Git will prove to be an invaluable companion. Happy coding!
