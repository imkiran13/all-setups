As you dive deeper into Git, understanding merging and rebasing becomes crucial for maintaining a clean and organized version history. Additionally, Git provides the stash feature to temporarily hide changes. Let's explore these concepts and commands to enhance your Git workflow.

### **Merging Branches in Git**

Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. Suppose we have multiple branches, such as 'movies,' 'recharge,' and 'master.' We want to merge changes from 'movies' into 'master' through 'recharge.' Here's how you can achieve that:

```plaintext
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Merge changes from 'movies' into 'master'
git merge movies
```

This process integrates changes from the 'movies' branch into the 'master' branch.

### **Rebasing in Git**

Rebasing is an alternative to merging and involves moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. This results in a linear history. To rebase 'movies' onto 'master':

```plaintext
# Switch to the branch you want to rebase (e.g., 'movies')
git checkout movies

# Rebase 'movies' onto 'master'
git rebase master
```

Keep in mind that while merging shows the entire commit history, rebasing provides a more streamlined history without displaying individual commits.

**Merge vs. Rebase**

* **Merge:**
    
    * Shows files involved in the merge.
        
    * Doesn't show individual branches.
        
    * Retains the entire commit history.
        
* **Rebase:**
    
    * Doesn't show files involved in the rebase.
        
    * Shows individual branches.
        
    * Results in a linear and cleaner commit history.
        

Choose between merge and rebase based on your project's needs and collaboration preferences.

### **Git Stash: Managing Uncommitted Changes**

Git stash is a powerful feature to temporarily hide changes that are not yet committed. This is useful when you need to switch branches without committing your current changes. Here's how you can use stash:

```plaintext
# Create a new file
touch file2

# Stash changes (stash only works with tracked but uncommitted changes)
git stash

# Apply stashed changes
git stash apply

# List stashes
git stash list

# Clear all stashes
git stash clear

# Pop the last stash (apply and drop)
git stash pop
```

Stash is particularly handy when you want to switch branches or perform other operations without committing incomplete changes.

Mastering these Git features will help you navigate complex version histories, streamline collaboration, and maintain a clean and organized codebase. Whether you opt for merging or rebasing, and use stash strategically, these tools contribute to an efficient and flexible Git workflow.
