### 1\. Overview

Trivy, an open-source vulnerability scanner, specializes in container images and applications. Widely utilized in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, Trivy ensures containerized applications are devoid of known vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security.

### 2\. Container Security

Containers encapsulate applications and dependencies. Trivy scans container images, focusing on vulnerabilities in operating system packages, libraries, and application dependencies, promoting robust container security.

### 3\. Features

* **Fast Scanning:** Trivy ensures quick vulnerability scans, ideal for integration into continuous integration (CI) processes.
    
* **Comprehensive Databases:** Utilizing CVE, NVD, and other vulnerability databases, Trivy identifies known vulnerabilities.
    
* **Ease of Use:** With a simple command-line interface, Trivy is user-friendly and integrable into various CI/CD tools.
    
* **Support for Multiple Languages:** Trivy is language-agnostic, analyzing container images with applications developed in various programming languages.
    

### 4\. Usage

* Run Trivy on container images during development and testing stages.
    
* Incorporate Trivy into CI/CD pipelines for automated vulnerability scanning during deployment.
    

### 5\. Integration

* Integrate Trivy with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, etc.
    
* An API allows developers and security teams to integrate vulnerability scanning into custom workflows.
    

### 6\. Output Formats

* Trivy provides scan results in formats such as JSON, YAML, etc., facilitating integration into diverse tools.
    

### 7\. Configuration Options

* Users can configure Trivy to exclude specific vulnerabilities or define custom policies based on security requirements.
    

### 8\. Continuous Updates

* Trivy's vulnerability databases receive regular updates to include the latest security information.
    

### Trivy Installation Steps

```plaintext
# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release

# Download Trivy public key and add it to the keyring
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg > /dev/null

# Add Trivy repository to sources list
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list

# Update package information
sudo apt-get update

# Install Trivy
sudo apt-get install trivy -y
```

### Execution Commands

Trivy supports various output formats such as "table," "json," "template," "sarif," "cyclonedx," "spdx," "spdx-json," "github," and "cosign-vuln."

### File System Scanning

```plaintext
# Scan a specific path
trivy fs path

# Scan a folder with specific scanners
trivy fs --scanners vuln,misconfig Folder_name_OR_Path

# Scan a folder with specific severity levels
trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL Folder_name_OR_Path

# Scan a folder with specific scanners and severity levels
trivy fs --scanners vuln,misconfig --severity HIGH,CRITICAL Folder_name_OR_Path

# Export the report
trivy fs --format table -o report.html folderpath
```

### Docker Image Scanning

```plaintext
# Scan a Docker image
trivy image imagename

# Scan a Docker image with specific severity levels
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL image_name

# Save the scan report to a file
trivy image --format table -o trivy_report.txt your_container_image
```

### Git Repository Scanning

```plaintext
# Scan a Git repository
trivy repo repo-url

# Example: Scan a GitHub repository
trivy repo repo-url https://github.com/jaiswaladi246/Ekart.git
```

### Kubernetes Cluster Scanning

```plaintext
# Scan a Kubernetes cluster and generate a summary report
trivy k8s --report summary cluster
```

### Additional Notes

* The GitHub repository for the Aqua Security Scanner Jenkins plugin can be found here.
    
* To retrieve a list of container images used by pods in a Kubernetes cluster, use the following command:
    

```plaintext
kubectl get pods -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.containers[*].image}{"\n"}{end}'
```

* The output can be piped to Trivy for vulnerability scanning:
    

```plaintext
kubectl get pods -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.containers[*].image}{"\n"}{end}' | trivy image --format json -
```

This command extracts container images from pod specifications and scans them using Trivy, with the output in JSON format.
