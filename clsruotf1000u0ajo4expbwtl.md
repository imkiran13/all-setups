Software architecture is the blueprint that defines the structure and organization of a software system. In this blog post, we'll explore different software architectures, breaking down the tiers and servers that make up these frameworks.

### **Understanding Tiers: Server and Layer**

Before diving into specific architectures, let's clarify the fundamental components: tiers and servers.

**Tiers:** These represent distinct layers or segments in a software application, each serving a specific purpose.

**Servers:** These are responsible for delivering services to end-users. In the context of software architecture, we primarily encounter three types:

1. **Web Server:**
    
    * **Purpose:** Presentation layer, showcasing the application.
        
    * **Who works here:** UI/UX developers.
        
    * **Tools used:** Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        
2. **App Server:**
    
    * **Purpose:** Logic layer, facilitating the use of the application.
        
    * **Who works here:** Backend developers.
        
    * **Tools used:** Programming languages like Java, Python, C, C++, .NET, and Go.
        
3. **DB Server:**
    
    * **Purpose:** Database layer, handling data storage and retrieval.
        
    * **Who works here:** Database administrators (DB admins).
        
    * **Tools used:** Database languages such as SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Arango.
        

### **One-Tier Architecture: Standalone Application**

The One-Tier architecture is akin to a standalone application that operates locally on a laptop. All layers, including the presentation, logic, and database, are self-contained within the local environment. Notably, it doesn't require an internet connection to function. An example of this architecture is the VLC Media Player.

### **Two-Tier Architecture: Client-Server Application**

In the Two-Tier architecture, the application still works on a local laptop, but the layers are distributed. The presentation and logic layers operate locally, while the database layer requires an internet connection. Commonly found in applications like banking systems, this setup facilitates seamless interaction between the client (user) and the server (database).

### **Three-Tier Architecture: Web Application (Real-time)**

In the Three-Tier architecture, the application is designed for web usage and doesn't necessarily need to be installed locally. All three layers - presentation, logic, and database - are accessible over the internet. Popular real-time web applications like WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram follow this architecture, allowing users to interact with the application seamlessly from anywhere with an internet connection.

Understanding these architectures provides a foundation for developing scalable, efficient, and responsive software systems. As technology continues to evolve, the need for robust software architectures becomes increasingly vital in delivering optimal user experiences.
