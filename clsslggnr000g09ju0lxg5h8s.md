In the vast landscape of web development, the ability to create and showcase a live web server environment is a skill that can set you apart. Today, we'll embark on a journey to demystify the process of creating a web server and presenting a live environment, using the robust infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

### Understanding the Essentials

Before we delve into the technicalities, let's clarify some fundamental concepts. A server, in its simplest form, is a computer that serves services to end-users. In the realm of web development, a web server is the key player responsible for presenting your application to the world.

### Setting the Stage with AWS and EC2

To initiate the creation of our web server, the first step is to have a cloud account. AWS offers a comprehensive cloud computing platform, and for our purpose, we'll be leveraging EC2 instances.

After SignIn Go to Services and search for EC2 then click on it.

### The Seven Steps to EC2 Enlightenment

**Tags - Giving Your Server a Distinct Identity:** Think of tags as the name tag for your server. It allows you to identify and manage your instances easily. Choosing an appropriate name enhances organization and clarity.

**AMI - The Blueprint for Your Server:** The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is the foundation of your server, encapsulating the operating system and essential software packages. Select an AMI tailored to your application's needs.

**Instance Type - Configuring CPU and RAM:** The instance type determines the computational power and memory resources allocated to your server. Choose a configuration that aligns with your application's requirements.

**Key Pair - Securing Your Path In:** Establish a secure login system with a key pair. AWS stores the public key, while you hold the private key. This ensures a secure and encrypted connection to your server.

**Network - Building the Virtual Fortress:** Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate and organize your resources. Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, specifying port numbers for various services (ranging from 0 to 65535).

**Storage - Determining the Digital Real Estate:** Select the appropriate storage size for your server, ranging from a modest 8 GB to a colossal 16 TB. Tailor this choice to your application's storage needs.

**Summary - A Last Glance Before Takeoff:** Take a moment to review your configured settings. This step ensures that your server is set up exactly as you intend it to be before launching into the digital space.

### Connecting with Your Creation - SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is the secure channel through which you communicate with your server. Operating on port 22, SSH employs your private key for authentication, maintaining a secure line of communication.  
For connecting to your ec2 server you can use putty or mobaXterm  
Go to session copy your ec2 instance public ip and username and connect to your server
